# systemd-services
Simple application for managing the systemd services.

V. 0.1 Free to use and modify.

Requirements for the qt6 version:

This application is just an attempt, and the user must know what to manage systemd. Usually, the commands stop, start, disable, mask, etc. are straightforward to understand.
